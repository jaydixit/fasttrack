<p>Top 4 Ways to Capture Event Attendee Photos</p>

<p>Enter the Matrix! Capture Futuristic Photos with a Camera Array</p>

<p>At a recent sponsored event, attendees lined up at HP&#8217;s booth to have their photo taken by a high-tech setup called the FotoZap Camera Array. As each group of guests jumped in the air, 25 professional cameras all fired at the same instant. The resulting image froze the moment in time and rotated it in space.</p>

<p>Participants were eager to see themselves in &#8220;bullet-time,&#8221; the same technology used in The Matrix, and to share their image as branded social media. High-tech setups like Camera Arrays draw attention to the sponsor&#8217;s event footprint and turn an attendee into a brand champion&#8211;someone who will share their branded photo on Facebook and talk about their experience with their friends.</p>
