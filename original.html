Immigration Matters
Welcome to the Immigration Project
Volunteers of Legal Service (VOLS) launched the Dream Not Deferred program in May 2011 to offer support for immigrant students to pursue higher education and
authorized employment. This program, directed by Elizabeta Markuci, partners pro bono counsel with students at high schools across New York City.
The idea for this project was formed after several undocumented students served through our School-based Children&#8217;s Project regulated their immigration status with the help of a lawyer. We recognized a need to expand our services when many of these students told us they would never have sought legal assistance had a school staff member not intervened; they said they thought nothing could be done.
The Dream Not Deferred program is designed to: (1) identify high school students who need legal assistance to obtain, or retain, lawful immigration status; (2) recruit, train and mentor lawyers to provide legal services to students with viable immigration relief; and (3) provide &#8220;know your rights&#8221; information to students currently unable to regularize their immigration status.
VOLS collaborates with school partners to ensure that community outreach is a key component of this project. We provide training for guidance counselors, college advisors and other school staff to create awareness about the challenges immigrant students face. We also give presentations to students and parents. As a direct result, several young people obtained legal assistance early enough to regulate their immigration status before graduationâ€”in time to qualify for financial aid for
college.
If you wish to refer a student, and your school is interested in partnering with VOLS, contact us through our Dream Not Deferred Hotline at: 347&#8211;521&#8211;5722. Please note we are only able to provide services to high school students enrolled at New York City schools.

Success Stories and Quotes
I found out about VOLS through my high school principal. When she learned about my undocumented status, she referred me to seek help from VOLS. When I came in for my first meeting , I was scared to talk about my situation because it was my first time speaking with a lawyer and I didn&#8217;t know what to expect.
During our meeting, Liz and I discussed my options so I could decide which legal remedy would be best for me. She made me feel comfortable and gave me the tools I needed to be able to apply for
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. After collecting all of my supporting documents, I attended a legal clinic where a volunteer lawyer helped me fill out application forms and file my case. I was nervous about revealing my status to the government and anxious as I waited to see if I was approved or not.
Thankfully,Iwasapproved. IrecentlygraduatedfromhighschoolandnowIamlookingforwardtofinding agoodjob.Oneofmydreamsistoworkwithkidsinneed.Ihada greatexperienceandIwoulddefinitely

In April of 2001, Kristen&#8217;s aunt, a United States citizen, filed a
family based immigrant visa petition for her brother, Kristen&#8217;s father. This petition would allow him to apply to become a permanent resident of the United States,
and his children could also receive derivative benefits until the age of 21. The visa petition was approved, and then placed in a queue. While Kristen&#8217;s family waited 11
years before they could move ahead to the next stage in the process,
Kristen&#8217;s aunt died, and the petition was automatically revoked. The
family sought legal assistance, but were told time and time again that they needed to wait for the law to change. Then in 2011, Kristen was screened by VOLS and learned that she and her father had a path to permanent immigration status by requesting &#8220;humanitarian reinstatement&#8221;. Volunteer lawyers were matched to represent Kristen and they successfully reinstated the revoked visa petition. This year, Kristen became a permanent resident and she is now working full-time at a local government office.

Welcome to the Immigration Project (Continued from page 1)
In the summer of 2012, President Obama announced the introduction of &#8220;Deferred Action for Child- hood Arrivals&#8221; (DACA), an administrative remedy offering temporary relief from removal for young people brought to the United States as children. Hoping to benefit from the two-year work authorization offered by DACA, many immigrant students have come to our school clinics seeking information and legal assistance. VOLS was able to serve their needs with the assistance of our pro bono partners, who hosted and volunteered at legal clinics held thoughout the past year. We wish to express our sincerest gratitude to the following law firms for their contributions to the Dream Not Deferred project:
Simpson, Thacher &amp; Bartlett ~ Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson
Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges ~ Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell ~ Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton
Debevoise &amp; Plimpton ~ Hughes, Hubbard &amp; Reed ~ Winston &amp; Strawn ~ Morrison &amp; Foerster Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler ~ Proskauer Rose ~ White &amp; Case
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom ~ Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale &amp; Dorr Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore ~ Schiff Hardin ~ Laura Devine &amp; Associates
Cyrus Mehta &amp; Associates
DID YOU KNOW? VOLS collaborated with the New Economy Project (formerly NEDAP) . Eligible students could apply for the NYC DREAMER Loan fund, which provides interest free loans to youth who were unable to file a request for DACA because they could not afford the $465 fee.
The mission of VOLS is to develop projects to provide pro bono civil legal services to benefit vulnerable New Yorkers, and to leverage the resources of law firms to serve this population. We identify areas of legal need, create projects to meet those needs, and recruit and train volunteer lawyers to provide legal services. In addition to young immigrants, VOLS projects serve diverse populations across New York City including children, elderly, claimants denied unemployment insurance benefits, incarcerated mothers, and low income microentrepreneurs.</p>
