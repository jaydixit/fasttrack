Immigration Matters
Welcome to the Immigration Project
Volunteers of Legal Service (VOLS) launched the Dream Not Deferred program in May 2011 to <strike>offer</strike> support <strike>for</strike> immigrant students <span class="added-text">in pursuing</span> <strike>to pursue</strike> higher education and
authorized employment. This program, directed by Elizabeta Markuci, <span class="added-text">helps</span> <strike>partners pro bono counsel with</strike> students at high schools across New York <span class="added-text">City by connecting them with qualified attorneys who will represent them pro bono.</span> <strike>City.</strike>
The <strike>idea for this</strike> project was <span class="added-text">created</span> <strike>formed</strike> after several undocumented students served through our School-based Children&#8217;s Project <span class="added-text"><em>regulated</span> <strike>regulated</strike> their immigration status with the help of a <span class="added-text">lawyer</em> <strong>what does this mean?</strong>. When</span> <strike>lawyer. We recognized a need to expand our services when many of these</strike> students told us they would never have sought legal assistance had a school <span class="added-text">official</span> <strike>staff member</strike> not <span class="added-text">intervened, we realized we needed to expand our services.</span> <strike>intervened; they said they thought nothing could be done.</strike>
The Dream Not Deferred program is designed to: (1) identify high school students who need legal assistance to <span class="added-text">obtain</span> <strike>obtain,</strike> or <span class="added-text">retain</span> <strike>retain,</strike> lawful immigration status; (2) recruit, <span class="added-text">train,</span> <strike>train</strike> and mentor lawyers to provide legal services to students with viable immigration relief; and (3) provide &#8220;know your rights&#8221; information to students currently unable to regularize their immigration status.
VOLS collaborates with <span class="added-text">schools</span> <strike>school partners</strike> to ensure that community outreach is a key component of this project. We provide training for guidance counselors, college <span class="added-text">advisors,</span> <strike>advisors</strike> and other school staff to create awareness about the challenges immigrant students face. We also give presentations to students and parents. <span class="added-text">We have helped countless</span> <strike>As a direct result, several</strike> young people <span class="added-text">to obtain</span> <strike>obtained</strike> legal assistance early enough to regulate their immigration status before graduationâ€”in time to qualify for financial aid for
college.

I found out about VOLS through my high school principal. When she learned about my undocumented status, she referred me to <strike>seek help from</strike> VOLS. When I came in for my first meeting , I was scared to talk about my situation because it was my first time <span class="added-text">talking to</span> <strike>speaking with</strike> a lawyer and I didn&#8217;t know what to expect.
During our meeting, Liz and I discussed my options so I could decide which legal remedy would be best for me. She made me feel comfortable and <span class="added-text">helped</span> <strike>gave</strike> me <strike>the tools I needed to be able to</strike> apply for
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. After collecting all of my supporting documents, I attended a legal clinic where a volunteer lawyer helped me fill out application forms and file my case. I was nervous about revealing my status to the government and anxious as I waited to see if I was approved or not.
Thankfully,Iwasapproved. IrecentlygraduatedfromhighschoolandnowIamlookingforwardtofinding agoodjob.Oneofmydreamsistoworkwithkidsinneed.Ihada greatexperienceandIwoulddefinitely

In April of 2001, Kristen&#8217;s aunt, a United States citizen, filed a
family based immigrant visa petition for her brother, Kristen&#8217;s father. This petition would allow him to apply to become a permanent resident of the United States,
and his children could also receive derivative benefits until the age of 21. The visa petition was approved, and then placed in a queue. While Kristen&#8217;s family waited 11
years before they could move ahead to the next stage in the process,
Kristen&#8217;s aunt <span class="added-text">died</span> <strike>died,</strike> and the petition <strike>was</strike> automatically revoked. The
family sought legal assistance, but were told time and time again <span class="added-text"><strong>by whom?</strong></span> that they needed to wait for the law to change. Then in 2011, Kristen was screened by VOLS and learned that she and her father had a path to permanent immigration status by requesting &#8220;humanitarian reinstatement&#8221;. Volunteer lawyers were matched to represent Kristen and they successfully reinstated the revoked visa petition. This year, Kristen became a permanent <span class="added-text">resident,</span> <strike>resident</strike> and she is now working <span class="added-text">full time</span> <strike>full-time</strike> at a local government office.
