Enter the Matrix! Capture Futuristic Photos with a Camera Array
 
At a recent sponsored event, attendees lined up at HP's booth to have their photo taken by a high-tech setup called the FotoZap Camera Array. As each group of guests jumped in the air, 25 professional cameras all fired at the same instant. The resulting image froze the moment in time and rotated it in space.

Participants were eager to see themselves in "bullet-time," the same technology used in The Matrix, and to share their image as branded social media. High-tech setups like Camera Arrays draw attention to the sponsor's event footprint and turn an attendee into a brand champion--someone who will share their branded photo on Facebook and talk about their experience with their friends.

Start Simple! Smart Devices Transform Staff Members into Event Photographers
 
With FotoZap installed on a tablet, phone, or connected camera, an event staff member can walk through the crowd, snapping photos or videos of attendees and immediately deliver a digital copy of the image by typing in the guest's email address, printing a glossy photo, or handing out a card with a unique URL.

 
Run the FotoZap app on an array of smart devices
 
To view their photo online, attendees must first fill out a lead generation form. It's a win-win: attendees get a photo enhanced with branded graphics from the event that they'll want to share with their friends, and you get to build your list.

Staff members can alter the image using any photo or video app on iOS or Android, then the FotoZap app brands the image and turns it into shareable social media. Morph two faces into one, create a nostalgic photo, drop a wrecking ball on a car, add attendees into a cartoon, or select from lots of other fun effects.

Get Physical! Construct a Scene with Props and a Movie Set
 
More and more, event holders are building elaborate physical backdrops, almost like movie sets, rather than relying on lifeless green-screens. At one recent event, attendees stood next to a crowd of mannequins holding protest signs. At another, attendees milked a full-sized plastic cow.
