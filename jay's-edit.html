<p>I am particularly honored to be here at Columbia University, one of the finest academic institutions in the world.</span> <strike>festival.</strike> </p>

<p>Films on the Green is organized <span

<p>Tonight, you are in</span> <strike>Department, and</strike> for <strike>the second year, the Columbia Maison Francaise offers</strike> a <span class="added-text">special treat&#8212;you</span> <strike>perfect &#8220;back-to-school&#8221; event to end our summer-long celebration of French cinema. </p>

<p>I am particularly honored we are at such a prominent location, the campus of Columbia University. Columbia is not only the prestigious home of great intellect, but also the home of amazing history and culture. Tonight, you</strike> are about to watch <span class="added-text">one of the greatest masterpieces</span> <strike>a true masterpiece</strike> of French cinema. </p>

<p>Jules and Jim, by Francois Truffaut, is based on the classic novel by Henri-Pierre <span class="added-text">Roche&#8212;in keeping with</span> <strike>Roche, as</strike> this <span class="added-text">year&#8217;s theme, which</span> <strike>year theme</strike> was <span class="added-text">&#8220;French</span> <strike>French</strike> and American literature on the big <span class="added-text">screen.&#8221; Jules and Jim</span> <strike>screen. It</strike> is a story of friendship, love, and sometimes <span class="added-text">passion&#8212;very much like</span> <strike>passion. So is</strike> the <span class="added-text">relationship between France and America.</span> <strike>French-American relationship.</strike> </p>

<p>I hope this evening will foster <strike>a wide desire for</strike> increased <span class="added-text">interest <strong>&#8220;increased access&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really make sense, because French art and film are already fully accessible</strong> in</span> <strike>access to</strike> French art <span class="added-text">and film</span> on <strike>many other</strike> American campuses, and for <span class="added-text">more</span> <strike>greater</strike> academic partnerships between our two countries. </p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of this amazing cultural exchange, and I hope to see you next year for the sixth <span class="added-text">season</span> <strike>edition</strike> of the Festival! </p>

<p>Bon film! </p>

<p>Hi/Bonjour everyone, </p>

<p>I am Antonin Baudry, and it is truly my pleasure, as the Cultural Counselor of the French Embassy in the US, to be before you tonight to conclude the fifth edition of Films on the Green festival. </p>

<p>Films on the Green is organized by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy and the New York Parks Department, and for the second year, the Columbia Maison Francaise offers a perfect &#8220;back-to-school&#8221; event to end our summer-long celebration of French cinema. </p>

<p>I am particularly honored we are at such a prominent location, the campus of Columbia University. Columbia is not only the prestigious home of great intellect, but also the home of amazing history and culture. Tonight, you are about to watch a true masterpiece of French cinema. </p>

<p>Jules and Jim, by Francois Truffaut, is based on the classic novel by Henri-Pierre Roche, as this year theme was French and American literature on the big screen. It is a story of friendship, love, and sometimes passion. So is the French-American relationship. </p>

<p>I hope this evening will foster a wide desire for increased access to French art on many other American campuses, and for greater academic partnerships between our two countries. </p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of this amazing cultural exchange, and I hope to see you next year for the sixth edition of the Festival! </p>
