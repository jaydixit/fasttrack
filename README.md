# This is my README

so this script takes a regular text file, which you will save with the filename original.md

then you make whatever edits you want to it, and save your edits under the filename final.md

and it creates output like this:
jaydixit.com/jdiffs/

it's Microsoft Word track changes, without the Microsoft Word
I don't think it already exists

## Vinh

i'm not aware of any
i was going to say it reminded me of the wordperfect redlining feature that law firms used to love

## me

I think it's very useful

## Vinh

that's the last thing that kept them from switching to ms word

## me

people are always sending me things and asking me to edit them
this makes it easy for me to make changes and show them visually what I've done
and I don't need to track changes myself or whatever
I just make the edits as I please
